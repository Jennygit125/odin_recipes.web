            <h2>Ingredients</h2>

                <li>2 cups Shredded Chicken. For 5-star flavor, use Rotisserie Chicken (dark and white meat mix) or pan-seared chicken thighs.</li>
                <li>1 tsp Smoked Paprika: Adds a subtle wood-fired depth.</li>
                <li>1 tsp Garlic Powder & 1 tsp Onion Powder: Essential for base flavor.</li>

                <li>1 can (10 oz) Diced Tomatoes with Green Chiles (undrained for moisture).</li>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Sauté the Base: In a large pan, melt 1 tbsp of butter. Sauté the fresh onion and garlic until fragrant (about 2 minutes).</li>
                <li>Season with Sauce: Stir in the cream of chicken, undrained tomatoes, and your entire seasoning blend. Whisk until smooth and bubbling.</li>
                <li>Cheesing up: Fold in the shredded cheese (about 1.5 to 2 cups) until the sauce is velvety.</li>
                <li>The Mixing: Add the cooked chicken and your pasta. Toss vigorously over low heat.</li>
                <li>If the sauce is too thick, add a splash of Chicken Broth or reserved Pasta Water to make it "silkier".</li>
                <li>Garnish: Finish with a heavy crack of black pepper and fresh parsley</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <p>This Chicken Spaghetti is creamy, cheesy, and slightly spicy dish that's served as my weeknight dinners or go to for casual gatherings. For an extra layer of flavor, consider adding sautéed mushrooms or bell peppers to the base. Leftovers also make for fantastic sandwiches or can be baked with an additional layer of cheese on top for a delicious casserole the next day</p>
